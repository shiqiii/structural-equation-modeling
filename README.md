Trust is an essential part of a legitimate political system. Based on the data of the 9th round European Social Survey in Belgium, this paper investigates the effect of people’s interest in politics on trust by implementing a mediation mechanism through people’s satisfaction of government services. This paper first reviews the relative literature and brings up a few assumptions and research questions. Then the mediation model with latent variables is constructed and relevant parameters are interpreted. Finally, the assumptions and research questions are checked and answered.
